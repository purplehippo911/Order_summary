## My process

First I started to add the image and the rest of the card, then I started with the background

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="main_image">
  <img
    src="images/illustration-hero.svg"
    alt="illustration of a girl listening to music"
  />
</div>
<h1 class="card_title">Order Summary</h1>
<p class="card_info">
  You can now listen to millions of songs, <br />
  audiobooks, and podcasts on any device <br />
  anywhere you like!
</p>
```

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  font-size: 16px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  background-color: var(--Pale_blue);
  text-align: center;
  background-image: url(/images/pattern-background-desktop.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  font-family: "Red Hat Display", sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

I think that I should try to learn CSS Grid and Flexbox, so I can get more comfortable with positioning elements, so I can get a good looking layout faster and easier. I want to continue getting better on JS so that I can begin on the challenges involving it, because I feel that I am comfortable with CSS and HTML.

### Useful resources

- [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me when I forgot some of the elements in css.
